# Ubiquiti mPower automation Telegram Bot

This bot allows you to control an Ubiquiti mPower device through a Telegram Bot, so you can plug it on or off from anywhere.

This is an afternoon hack, so use it under your own responsibility.

You can find a demo showing off this bot here: https://youtu.be/KrA1NboSdX8
